# BombMinigame
Small game inspired by a minigame in New Super Mario Bros. DS where players must sort black and red bombs into their respective slots.
Taking too long or placing a bomb in the wrong slot results in a game over.


There were plenty of great minimages in that game, but this one always stood out to me as particularly fun and addicting.

I plan on eventually releasing this as a mobile game.
